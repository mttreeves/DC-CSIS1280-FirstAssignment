            <h3>Tourism</h3>
            <p>Majority of people go to Paris to sight-see. There isn't a specific activity you can expect besides biking. But to be
            fair, most of Europe is a hotspot for tourism. So to be quite frank, the best recreational activities to do in Paris
            is to visit all the exotic architectural masterpieces that has been so beautifully preserved. All of the monuments that 
            you have seen here today are the places that are most recommended to visit.</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>The Eiffel Tower:</dt>
                <dd>The tower portrayed architectural art way ahead of its present era. Today, it is one of the most well-known locations
                    to travel to.
                </dd>
                <dt>Cath&eacute;drale Notre-Dame de Paris:</dt>
                <dd>Although it has been burned and is still in the process of being rebuilt, it is recommended to visit this cathedral
                    when it opens in order to see if we were able to replicate architecture from centuries ago, if not, be able to witness
                    what new wonders they were able to implement into the structure.
                </dd>
                <dt>Arc de Triomphe:</dt>
                <dd>Endorsed highly to be visited by ones who take history very dearly, and those who really respect military geniousity.
                    Not only is this location sacred to the mility genius Napoleon, it is also a site where the world saw a very dark time
                    during the Second World War, the fall of France to the German Reich. Hence, it is a historic location for more than one
                    reason.
                </dd>
                <dt>The Louvre Pyramid:</dt>
                <dd>The Pyramid project within the Louvre Museum was another very unpopular idea, it was built in 1989 by a Chinese-American
                    named Ming Pei. Overall, it was soon recognized as another architectural achievement, as it is now classified as having 
                    modern and futuristic architectural styles.
