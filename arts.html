            <h3>Arts</h3>
            <p>
                What comes to your mind when you think about Paris? If your answer is the Eiffel Tower you are most likely
                the majority... you would be surprised how many people don't know their physical geography. Anyway, the Eiffel Tower
                was built in 1889 and at the time, it wasn't as popular as it is today. In fact, the majority of the French population
                at the time disliked it. People thought that it ruined the iron structure ruined the classic and elegant design the city
                of Paris. Additionally, the tower was planned to be removed after 20 years because its sole purpose at the time was to celebrate
                the French Revolution's centennial year the <i>Exposition Universelle</i>e and show other nations the industrial abilities of France. 

                You may be asking why the Eiffel Tower is still standing today. Well that is because the first broadcasts of radio began in 1897, 
                so the Eiffel Tower became a strategic point for the city, being 300 meters tall had its advantages. The city of Paris was convinced
                to keep the tower because of the strategic and military utility it offered. It later proved to be true with the outbreak of the 
                First World War. The tower captured important telegrams and deciphered information.

            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>
                France doesn't just have culture. Did you know that the word "culture" originated from French!
                The word "culture" derives from the same French term, which in turn derives from the Latin term 'colere.'
                This is all because of the legendary historical events France, and ultimately Paris, was apart of. Historically,
                French culture could only have been influenced by the other cultures that came before. Naming a few, the Celtic and Gallo-
                Roman cultures, these historical tribes and empires have left a <i>huge</i> footprint in the current French culture we see today.
