            <p>On April 15 2019, a fire broke out beneath the roof of Cath&eacute;drale Notre-Dame de Paris. One of the few historical 
                cathedrals built in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It was a devastating day for Parisians and a huge loss of a
                beautiful structure for the entire world. Eversince, it has been in the process of being rebuilt, but it has faced many
                delays due to the outbreak of the coronavirus. It is expected to be open for visits in the year of 2024, but nothing is 
                set in stone. You may think that this is a significant amount of time to rebuild a cathedral but in fact, when the first
                construction started in 1163, it took almost 200 years to finish the structure. The construction officially finished in 
                1345, let this be a reminder of how precious this jewel of Gothic architecture is.<br><br><br>

            <p>The Arc de Triomphe was built per Napol&eacute;on's demand and is one of the most famous monuments in Paris. It started 
                construction in 1806, after the famous battle of Austerlitz &lpar;1805&rpar;, which was considered his military 
                &quot;masterpiece.&quot; The construction finished in 1836, and in addition to being a memorial for the brave soldiers, the Arc
                de Triomphe was also a gate that welcomed Napol&eacute;on and his troops back from battles.
