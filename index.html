        <h3>History of Paris</h3>
        <blockquote>The history of Paris dates back to 259 BC, first settled by a Celtic tribe known as the Parisii.
            The fisherman village was then conquered by the Romans in 52 BC, where the Gallo-Roman town Lutetia was founded.
            The city changed its name to Paris during the fourth century. Since then Paris has been a major part of many empires,
            dynasties, and nations. To name a few: Romans, the Franks, Capetian Dynasty, and France.
